# QuizforCoding

<h2>Objective: Make an interactive Quiz using Javascript</h2>


<h4>Description of Application</h4>
    <p> When clicked on the deployed link, the user will be brought to the index.html page where the quiz will start and take place.
    Once the start button has cliked. A timer in the middle of the screen will display which was created with Javascript. The user will answer
    the quiz as fast as they can to achieve the highest score possible. If a wrong answer is given, time will be subtracted from the timer thus
    lowering the score the individual takes. At the end of the quiz, the user will be told the score and prompted to play their intials into a 
    highscore leaderboard so the user can be on top!</p>


<h4> Process of Creation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First was to create html and place the skelton of application. A location is needed for timer and to hold the questions</li>
        <li>After the html skeleton was made, a Javascript file had to be created and make a function for a timer. An event listener is required for
        button Start Quiz which will intiate the quiz and the timer.</li>
        <li>One can not take a quiz without questions. I seperated questions into a seperate JS file to organize code effectively. I did not have to
        50 lines of code for questions on the same JS file as the timer and other functions. I can simply pull from the questions anytime.</li>
        <li>On the js.js file, variables are needed for the important segments of the quiz such as score and value for a timer to countdown from. Had to assign
        values to variables with IDs to </li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
